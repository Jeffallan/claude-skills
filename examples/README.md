# Workflow Examples

This directory contains practical, step-by-step workflow examples demonstrating how multiple skills work together to solve real development tasks.

While `SKILLS_GUIDE.md` explains what each skill does, these examples show **how skills chain together in real-world scenarios**.

## Why These Examples Exist

New users often understand individual skills but struggle with:

- When to use which skill
- How to sequence them
- How outputs from one skill feed into another
- How to structure real development workflows

These examples bridge that gap.

## How to Use These Examples

Each example includes:

- Skills used
- Step-by-step invocation
- Sample outputs
- Code excerpts
- Explanation of skill chaining

You can:

- Follow the walkthrough directly
- Adapt the structure to your own project
- Use it as a template for your team workflows
