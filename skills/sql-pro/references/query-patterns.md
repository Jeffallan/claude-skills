## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

```sql
-- Basic CTE for readability
WITH active_users AS (
    SELECT user_id, username, created_at
    FROM users
    WHERE is_active = true
      AND last_login >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
),
user_orders AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as order_count, SUM(total) as total_spent
    FROM orders
    WHERE status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT
    u.username,
    u.created_at,
    COALESCE(o.order_count, 0) as orders,
    COALESCE(o.total_spent, 0) as lifetime_value
FROM active_users u
LEFT JOIN user_orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
WHERE COALESCE(o.order_count, 0) > 0
ORDER BY o.total_spent DESC;

-- CTE with multiple references (avoiding duplicate computation)
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) as month,
        product_id,
        SUM(quantity) as total_quantity,
        SUM(amount) as total_amount
    FROM sales
    WHERE sale_date >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date), product_id
)
SELECT
    current.month,
    current.product_id,
    current.total_amount,
    current.total_amount - COALESCE(previous.total_amount, 0) as growth,
    ROUND(100.0 * (current.total_amount - COALESCE(previous.total_amount, 0))
        / NULLIF(previous.total_amount, 0), 2) as growth_pct
FROM monthly_sales current
LEFT JOIN monthly_sales previous
    ON current.product_id = previous.product_id
    AND current.month = previous.month + INTERVAL '1 month';
```

## Recursive CTEs

```sql
-- Organizational hierarchy traversal
WITH RECURSIVE org_hierarchy AS (
    -- Anchor member: top-level managers
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        name,
        manager_id,
        1 as level,
        ARRAY[employee_id] as path,
        name as hierarchy_path
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive member: employees reporting to current level
    SELECT
        e.employee_id,
        e.name,
        e.manager_id,
        h.level + 1,
        h.path || e.employee_id,
        h.hierarchy_path || ' > ' || e.name
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN org_hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
    WHERE NOT e.employee_id = ANY(h.path)  -- Prevent cycles
)
SELECT
    employee_id,
    REPEAT('  ', level - 1) || name as indented_name,
    level,
    hierarchy_path
FROM org_hierarchy
ORDER BY path;

-- Bill of materials (parts explosion)
WITH RECURSIVE parts_explosion AS (
    SELECT
        part_id,
        component_id,
        quantity,
        1 as level,
        ARRAY[part_id] as path
    FROM bill_of_materials
    WHERE part_id = 'PRODUCT-123'

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        pe.part_id,
        bom.component_id,
        pe.quantity * bom.quantity,
        pe.level + 1,
        pe.path || bom.part_id
    FROM parts_explosion pe
    INNER JOIN bill_of_materials bom ON pe.component_id = bom.part_id
    WHERE NOT bom.part_id = ANY(pe.path)
)
SELECT
    component_id,
    SUM(quantity) as total_quantity,
    MAX(level) as max_depth
FROM parts_explosion
GROUP BY component_id;
```

## Advanced JOIN Patterns

```sql
-- Self-join for finding gaps in sequences
SELECT
    a.order_id as current_id,
    MIN(b.order_id) as next_id,
    MIN(b.order_id) - a.order_id - 1 as gap_size
FROM orders a
LEFT JOIN orders b ON b.order_id > a.order_id
GROUP BY a.order_id
HAVING MIN(b.order_id) - a.order_id > 1;

-- LATERAL join for correlated subqueries (PostgreSQL)
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    recent.order_date,
    recent.total
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT order_date, total
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    ORDER BY order_date DESC
    LIMIT 3
) recent;

-- Anti-join pattern (records in A not in B)
SELECT u.user_id, u.email
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;

-- Using EXISTS (more efficient than IN for large sets)
SELECT u.user_id, u.email
FROM users u
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.user_id = u.user_id
);
```

## Subquery Optimization

```sql
-- Scalar subquery in SELECT (use sparingly - can cause N+1)
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews r WHERE r.product_id = p.product_id) as review_count,
    (SELECT AVG(rating) FROM reviews r WHERE r.product_id = p.product_id) as avg_rating
FROM products p;

-- Better: Use JOINs with aggregation
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.name,
    COALESCE(r.review_count, 0) as review_count,
    r.avg_rating
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        COUNT(*) as review_count,
        AVG(rating) as avg_rating
    FROM reviews
    GROUP BY product_id
) r ON p.product_id = r.product_id;

-- Correlated subquery for filtering
SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    total
FROM orders o1
WHERE total > (
    SELECT AVG(total)
    FROM orders o2
    WHERE o2.customer_id = o1.customer_id
);

-- Better: Use window functions
SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    total
FROM (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        customer_id,
        total,
        AVG(total) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) as avg_customer_total
    FROM orders
) x
WHERE total > avg_customer_total;
```

## PIVOT/UNPIVOT Operations

```sql
-- PostgreSQL CROSSTAB (requires tablefunc extension)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

SELECT * FROM crosstab(
    'SELECT customer_id, product_category, SUM(amount)
     FROM sales
     GROUP BY customer_id, product_category
     ORDER BY customer_id, product_category',
    'SELECT DISTINCT product_category FROM sales ORDER BY 1'
) AS ct(customer_id INT, electronics NUMERIC, clothing NUMERIC, food NUMERIC);

-- Manual PIVOT with CASE
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_category = 'electronics' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as electronics,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_category = 'clothing' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as clothing,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_category = 'food' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as food
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- UNPIVOT pattern (row to column)
SELECT customer_id, 'electronics' as category, electronics as amount
FROM customer_sales WHERE electronics > 0
UNION ALL
SELECT customer_id, 'clothing', clothing
FROM customer_sales WHERE clothing > 0
UNION ALL
SELECT customer_id, 'food', food
FROM customer_sales WHERE food > 0;
```

## Set Operations

```sql
-- UNION for combining distinct results
SELECT product_id FROM active_products
UNION
SELECT product_id FROM featured_products;

-- UNION ALL for better performance (includes duplicates)
SELECT user_id, 'signup' as event FROM signups WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE
UNION ALL
SELECT user_id, 'purchase' as event FROM purchases WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE;

-- INTERSECT for common records
SELECT email FROM newsletter_subscribers
INTERSECT
SELECT email FROM premium_members;

-- EXCEPT for difference (A - B)
SELECT email FROM all_users
EXCEPT
SELECT email FROM unsubscribed_users;
```

## Performance Tips

1. **CTE Materialization**: PostgreSQL 12+ materializes CTEs by default. Use `WITH cte AS MATERIALIZED` or `NOT MATERIALIZED` to control
2. **JOIN Order**: Database optimizers handle this, but put smaller tables first in manual optimization
3. **EXISTS vs IN**: Use EXISTS for correlated checks, IN for small static lists
4. **Subquery vs JOIN**: Prefer JOINs for readability and optimizer friendliness
5. **UNION ALL vs UNION**: Use UNION ALL when duplicates are acceptable (no deduplication cost)
